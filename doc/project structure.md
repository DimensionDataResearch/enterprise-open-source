# Structuring your project

At the ABSOLUTE minimum, your project must have-

1. A [README.md]() file, explaining what your project does, what state it is in and (briefly) how to use it.
2. A [LICENCE](Licensing.md) file, with your selected license. Refer to [Licensing](Licensing.md) for guidance on choosing a license.

## More than the bare-minimum

Your project should also have:

### 1. A documentation directory

### 2. A contributing file

## Consider your audience


* Keep the top-level folder uncluttered.
